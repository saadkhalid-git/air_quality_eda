# Comparative Analysis of Air Quality and Water Pollution

This repository contains a Python notebook that analyzes air quality and water pollution across 5,000+ cities worldwide. The analysis explores the relationships between air and water pollution, highlights the most polluted and cleanest countries, and provides insights into urbanization's impact on pollution levels.

## Project Overview

The study uses a dataset sourced from Kaggle that provides air quality and water pollution metrics for cities around the world. The notebook contains exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and summary statistics to answer key research questions related to air and water pollution.

### Key Research Questions
1. What are the top 10 most polluted and cleanest countries in terms of air and water pollution?
2. What are the outlier patterns observed when comparing air quality and water quality across different countries?
3. What kind of relationship exists between air quality and water quality across various regions?

### Dataset Information
- **Source**: Kaggle's *World Cities Air Quality and Water Pollution* dataset.
- **Columns**:
  - `City`: Name of the city.
  - `Country`: Country where the city is located.
  - `AirQuality`: Average Air Quality Index (AQI) of the city.
  - `WaterPollution`: Average water pollution index of the city.
  - `Population`: Population of the city.
  - `Latitude` & `Longitude`: Geographical coordinates of the city.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following dependencies installed:

### Python Version
- Python 3.7 or higher

### Required Libraries
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `scikit-learn`: For regression models used in the analysis.

You can install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file provided:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can manually install them using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scikit-learn
```

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The notebook performs the following data cleaning steps:
- Removing leading/trailing whitespaces from columns and data entries.
- Dropping unnecessary columns (`Region`).
- Creating two new columns:
  - `AirPollution`: Calculated by subtracting `AirQuality` from 100.
  - `WaterQuality`: Calculated by subtracting `WaterPollution` from 100.

## Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-water-pollution-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd air-water-pollution-analysis
   ```

3. Make sure you have the dataset file (`cities_air_quality_water_pollution.18-10-2021.csv`) available in the project directory.

4. Install the required packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

6. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, open the `Air_and_Water_Pollution_Analysis.ipynb` notebook.

7. Run the notebook cells in order to see the analysis.

## Visualization

The notebook includes several key visualizations:
- **Top 10 Most Polluted and Cleanest Countries**: Bar plots displaying the countries with the highest/lowest levels of air and water pollution.
- **Outliers in Air and Water Quality**: Boxplots to identify outlier countries in air and water pollution levels.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Scatterplots and linear regression analysis to determine the relationship between air quality and water pollution.

## Results and Key Insights

- **Top Polluted Countries**: Countries such as Central African Republic, Guinea, and Niger show significantly high air and water pollution.
- **Cleanest Countries**: Countries like Croatia, Slovenia, and Singapore show excellent air and water quality.
- **Outliers**: Notable outliers are found in air quality but not water quality, with some countries showing air pollution levels well above the median.
